### Hi there üëã

I am a Frontend Developer, where I specialize in creating and enhancing e-commerce websites. My role involves building online stores and implementing improvements to enhance user experience. 
I also have experience in developing custom themes for websites using, Vite, Tailwind, JS, SCSS, CSS, HTML, Gulp, Webpack, and more. 
In addition, I have worked on creating end-to-end (E2E) tests using Cypress. Additionally, I optimize online stores for performance, focusing on enhancing Core Web Vitals to ensure a smooth and efficient user experience.

A significant portion of my time is dedicated to building applications in React JS or Vue.js. I am constantly striving to expand my knowledge and learn new technologies. Currently, I am focusing on learning TypeScript.

Apart from my work, I contribute to open-source projects such as PrestaShop and Hummingbird for PrestaShop. I enjoy collaborating with the open-source community and leveraging my skills to contribute to these projects.

Theme for a Large Clothing Store:
I designed a modern and responsive theme that accentuates the style and character of the clothing brand. I also integrated advanced features such as animations, parallax effects.

Theme for a Polish Jewelry Store:
I crafted an elegant and luxurious theme that highlights the uniqueness of the offered jewelry. I also introduced interactive product galleries and optimized the UX for the purchasing process.

Maintenance for a Large Polish Bookstore:

üõ†Ô∏è Other Projects:

Eatlyfi Project:
Together with a team of passionate developers, we're building 'Eatlyfi' from the ground up, a comprehensive recipe platform. Our mission is to provide users with a seamless experience in discovering, sharing, and creating recipes. My primary role in this project is crafting the user interfaces using Next.js, ensuring that the platform is not only functional but also visually appealing and user-friendly.
