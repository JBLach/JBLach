### Hi there 👋

I am a Frontend Developer, where I specialize in creating and enhancing e-commerce websites. My role involves building online stores and implementing improvements to enhance user experience. 
I also have experience in developing custom themes for websites using, Vite, Tailwind, JS, SCSS, CSS, HTML, Gulp, Webpack, and more. 
In addition, I have worked on creating end-to-end (E2E) tests using Cypress. Additionally, I optimize online stores for performance, focusing on enhancing Core Web Vitals to ensure a smooth and efficient user experience.

A significant portion of my time is dedicated to building applications in React JS or Vue.js. I am constantly striving to expand my knowledge and learn new technologies. Currently, I am focusing on learning TypeScript.

Apart from my work, I contribute to open-source projects such as PrestaShop and Hummingbird for PrestaShop. I enjoy collaborating with the open-source community and leveraging my skills to contribute to these projects.
